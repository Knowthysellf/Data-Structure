A data structure is a way to store and organize
data in a computer , so that it can be used 
efficiently 
we talk about data structures as:
1. mathematical / logical models or abstract data types
2. implementation

Now there might be a situation when we need operations for
our user-defined data type which have to be defined. 
These operations can be defined only as and when we require
them. So, in order to simplify the process of solving problems, 
we can create data structures along with their operations, 
and such data structures that are not in-built are known as 
Abstract Data Type (ADT).

The data is generally stored in key sequence in a list which has a head structure consisting of count, pointers and address of compare function needed to compare the data in the list.
The data node contains the pointer to a data structure and a self-referential pointer which points to the next node in the list.
The List ADT Functions is given below:
get() – Return an element from the list at any given position.
insert() – Insert an element at any position of the list.
remove() – Remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.
removeAt() – Remove the element at a specified location from a non-empty list.
replace() – Replace an element at any position by another element.
size() – Return the number of elements in the list.
isEmpty() – Return true if the list is empty, otherwise return false.
isFull() – Return true if the list is full, otherwise return false.

 -empty list has size 0
--insert 
 -remove 
 -count 
 -read /modify  element at a position 
 -specify data type
